        <p>From April'18 - July'19, I worked as a UX Designer at Microsoft, where I was a part of the <span style="font-weight:400;border-bottom: 1px solid currentColor;"><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/backup/" target="_blank">Azure Backup</a></span> team. The Azure Backup team comprised of ~16 Product Managers, and over 100 developers. I was the only designer in the team.</p>

        <h4 style="color:#B51A17; padding-bottom: 15px;">Core priorities</h4> 
        <h2>My core priorities</h2>
        <p>Being the only designer in the Azure Backup team, I got involved in the product and the product meetings early on. Azure platform has a variety of offerings - for example, Azure Backup, Azure Monitor, Azure Networking, and so on - with product teams distributed across the world. Here were some of my core priorities:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
          <li style="padding-bottom: 20px;"><strong>Take ownership, and deliver delightful UX for Azure Backup</strong> by gaining a deep understanding of the product, the users, and their needs. Maintain living and breathing design documentation for features, which includes these needs to help keep all stakeholders (PMs and engineering) on the same page.</li>
          <li style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Create experiences which are intuitive and simple to use by following a design process that promotes <strong>out-of-box thinking along with ensuring that the design is delivered on time.</strong></li>
          <li style="padding-bottom: 20px;"><strong>Design as one:</strong> Involve and engage internal (PMs, Engineers and fellow designers) and external stakeholders (users) in the design process early on. This helps in getting diverse thoughts, and will ensure quality deliverables which account for developmental constraints early on. Increased visibility of PM and engineering stakeholders in the design process will shorten feedback cycles.</li>
          <li>Most importantly: Ensure the UX of Azure Backup is of high quality and is <strong>consistent with other Azure products</strong> by engaging with other Azure design partners more deeply. Azure has a variety of offerings, for example, Azure Monitor, Azure Networking, and so on. Though each offering had a separate team, we all had to take responsibility to keep the user experience of the platform consistent which required close collaboration among various design teams.</li>

        <h4 style="color:#B51A17; padding-bottom: 15px;">Contributions</h4> 
        <h2>My major contributions</h2>
        <p>For the initial few months after I joined, I was responsible for delivering the UX for various small features. From January 2019 - July 2019, I was responsible for the UX of <strong>Azure Backup Center</strong> - a new platform in Azure to manage all backup related activities.</p>

        <h4 style="color:#B51A17; padding-bottom: 15px;">Learnings</h4> 
        <h2 style="padding-bottom: 30px;">My core learnings</h2>
        <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
          <li style="padding-bottom: 20px;"><strong>Measuring impact when one is part of a team:</strong> At Microsoft, we measure an individual's "impact" by taking three factors into consideration - one's individual contributions, how one builds on others work and ideas, and how one helps others. This was emphasised by the leadership, as well as in the corporate trainings, which was great and helped me see the meaning of 'impact' from a totally different perspective!</li>
          <li style="padding-bottom: 20px;"><strong>User experience is a part of a larger vision:</strong> Each team followed a triad model (PM, Engineering, Design), and effective collaboration with cross functional teams went a long way in delivering good UX. Every UX decision impacted the underlying engineering model, as well as the business goals, so it was important for me to understand both of them. More specifically, the Azure Backup Center project involved rewriting the codebase, so understanding the underlying engineering model, and defining the UX with engineering constrains was challenging and a good learning experience for me.</li>
          <li><strong>Communication and prioritisation:</strong> Collaborating with multiple Product Managers on different features parallely helped me learn the art of estimating and communicating timelines, doing hard prioritisation for myself, and delivering the designs on time.</li>
