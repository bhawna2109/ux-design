        <h2>Postman did not support an app-wide find and replace functionality</h2>
        <p>Users work with large amounts of data in Postman. However, there was no support to find something across all or parts of that data. Furthermore, there was no replace functionality. Thus, if a variable name got changed, users had to manually replace each instance of the variable across the app. This was time consuming and not productive.</p>

        <p>Find and replace was a long awaited feature in Postman - we had been getting several feature requests on Github over the years around supporting bulk refactoring in the app.</p>

        <p>What do developers like and dislike? Talking to my developer peers at Postman, and interacting with developers through github, twitter and zendesk helped me understand some likes and dislikes of developers.</p>

        <h2>Early explorations</h2>
        <p>To start off, we firstly wanted to identify the real estate in the app where the find and replace feature would exist. After some intial brainstorming, we decided to have a launch point in the bottom bar which would bring up the find and replace bottom sheet. I started sketching rough flows and then created first draft of wireframes. These wireframes went through a design-dogfooding-iteration loop before we converged on the final design.</p>

        <h2>Bringing up the find and replace bottom sheet</h2>
        <p>We found from comparative analysis that CMD/CTRL+SHIFT+F is an expected shortcut to bring up find and replace (all) across all developer tools. To preserve user's existing mental model, we decided on having the same shortcut to bring up the "Find and replace" bottom sheet. We also added "Esc" key for exiting find and replace.</p>   
        <p>In addition to a keyboard shortcut, we also added a prominent find and replace icon in the bottom bar. Clicking this icon would open up a bottom sheet to perform find and replace. We intentionally decided to not make this bottom sheet a modal in order to NOT make the rest of the interface non usable.</p>

        <p>To solve for this task, I included a text box to enter the search query. In addition, I added the options "Regex" and "Ignore case" to allow for more flexible searches (implementing our finding from comparative analysis).</p>   
        <p>Our comparative analysis also showed that some tools support real-time search which is a good-to-have. However, there were implementation challenges associated with showing search results as the user was typing. Thus, we decided to show search results only when an explicit "Find" action was triggered by the user.</p>

        <h2>Find "where"</h2>
        <p>From our <span style="border-bottom: 1px solid currentColor;"><a href="#job-stories">job stories</a></span>, we know that users wanted the ability to find within specific Postman entities (current collection vs all collections). In addition, our job stories also show that users wanted to search within specific "fields" within an entity, for example, "URL field" of a request or "tests field" of a request. It was clear that we needed to support the ability to view search results for specific Postman entities (collections, environments, globals), as well as specific fields within those entities. I noted down all the Postman entities and the fields within each entity (which were different for each entity).</p>

        <h2>Design rationale behind the final design decision</h2>
        <p>I created an internal team wiki page (on Confluence) and wrote down the design rationale behind the design decision of supporting filtering action on fields after the search results are shown.</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 20px; padding-top: 30px;">
          <li style="padding-bottom: 20px;"><strong>Scalability:</strong> Showing both entities and fields before searching makes the Find section overwhelming. This complexity will increase when we add more entities/fields in the future.</li>
          <li style="padding-bottom: 20px;"><strong>User context:</strong> From a user's perspective, they're almost always sure about the entity they want to find in. Our <span style="border-bottom: 1px solid currentColor;"><a href="#job-stories">job stories</a></span> show that typically they're working with a single collection and want to perform find/replace within that. In addition, the job stories also listed few scenarios when users did NOT specify a "field" to search in. This design supports those scenarios while also supporting the ability to filter/play around with the search results later.</li>
          <li style="padding-bottom: 20px;"><strong>Fast loading:</strong> If a user chooses specific entities instead of finding in "everything", they'll get the search results faster, since there will be less data to perform the search in the backend. We will not get the same loading advantage if a user could limit the "fields" too before search. Supports our design principle "Optimize UX for fast loading times whenever possible."</li>
          <li style="padding-bottom: 20px;"><strong>Quick results:</strong> This approach ensures that the user does not have to set up a proper configuration before seeing a single search result. Supports our design principle "Focus on how quickly and effectively users are able to get their job done."</li>
          <li style="padding-bottom: 20px;"><strong>Better context:</strong> Since fields are different for each entity, they can be shown contexually for each entity (tab) in search results.</li>

        <p>As part of the design process, the designers had to lay out the user interactions that were valuable to track in order to measure success as well as identify areas of improvement.

          <li style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Look at user analytics data to see which entities the users are searching in as well as how the field filters are being used. I believe there is more opportunity to simplify the design by removing options that are not quite useful.</li>
