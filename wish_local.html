        <h2>Wish Local stores were having a hard time managing Wish inventory in their store</h2>
        <p>The <span style="border-bottom: 1px solid currentColor;"><a href="https://www.wishlocal.com/" target="_blank">Wish Local</a></span> program enables brick-and-mortar stores to be pickup locations for <span style="border-bottom: 1px solid currentColor;"><a href="https://www.wish.com/" target="_blank">Wish</a></span> orders. Launched around 2.5 years ago as an experimental initiative, the program today has over 60k+ store partners. Stores use the Wish Local app to track and manage Wish orders, and process customer pickups.</p>
        <p>The app showed a plain vanilla list of all Wish orders which did not meet the needs of the stores. Our customer support requests showed that it was painful for stores to manage a large number of Wish orders.</p>

        <p>The team wanted to launch a program that would result in stores receiving, even more, Wish inventory. However, before we launched this program, we knew that first, we had to thoughtfully address the current problems stores were having with managing Wish inventory.</p>

        <h2>One month to craft a helpful inventory management UX</h2>
        <p>Our goal for the project was to craft an experience that would help stores effectively manage Wish inventory in their physical location using the Wish Local app.</p>

        <h2>My role</h2>
        <p>I was the sole designer for this project and worked on the project between May–June 2021 (end-to-end).</p>
        <p>I worked alongside a UX Writer and a Product Manager. In addition, I also consulted with a UX Researcher to get feedback on my Interview Protocol. Lastly, I collaborated closely with developers during the development phase to ensure quality implementation.</p>
        <p>The project was launched on November 1, 2021.</p>

        <h2>Understanding the ambiguous problem space</h2>
        <p>The problem space for this project was large and ambiguous – we knew that managing inventory is painful for stores, but that was it. There were no specific insights or goals for the inventory management experience. To understand the exact problems stores are facing, we conducted user interviews.</p>
        <p>I consulted with our User Researcher on our research plan. We interviewed 9 power stores (5 in the US, 4 in Mexico) over video conferencing. Our goals were to uncover the problems stores were facing with managing inventory, understand how stores were organizing inventory in their physical location, and factors that influenced how they managed inventory.</p>

        <p>I used this critical insight to deeply think through how can we design the inventory management experience. Writing down my thoughts helps me break down problems. Below are some snippets from my FigJam document showing my thinking:</p>

        <h2>Let's meet Rob to get the full picture</h2>
        <p>I created a storyboard using our existing illustration library to put myself and stakeholders in users' shoes. I used this story during design crits to quickly set the context before presenting my designs. The storyboard included insights we got from interviews, for example, showing the scale of items stores have to handle, how busy the storeowner is while processing a pickup, how the customer might also be in a rush, and how stores organize Wish inventory in their stores for quick pickup.</p>

        <h2>How stores currently organize Wish inventory in their physical location</h2>
        <p>Here are some insights we got:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
          <li>Stores did not have guidance or best practices around how to best organize inventory in their physical location</li>
          <li>As a result, stores had self-invented ways of making small bundles of inventory for a quick pickup process</li>
          <li>One store mentioned they tour nearby stores to see how they are organizing inventory</li>
          <li>The most common organization method found: Separate "Ready for Pickup" and "Listed for sale" items, and organize "Ready for pickup" items in smaller bundles based on the first letter of the package code.</li>

        <h2>How might we bridge the gap between physical and digital? How might we help stores maintain the inventory organization?</h2>
        <p>Our hypothesis was that stores will benefit if the app provided guidance around how to organize inventory, the inventory organization in the app reflected how stores want to organize item in their location, and if the app provided tools to help stores maintain the organization. Below are some interview insights that informed our hypothesis: </p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
          <li>Ability to sort items in the app alphabetically – reflect the physical organization method in-app</li>
          <p style="color: #727272; padding-top: 0;">"I organize items that are ready for pickup in my store alphabetically. Thus, I would like to be able to sort items in my app alphabetically"</p>
          <li>If any item activity happened in the app, stores would like to take action on the item in their physical location too:</li>
          <p style="color: #727272; padding-top: 0;">"When an item doesn't get picked up and gets relisted for sale, I would like to know when that happens so I can move that item in my store to its correct location"</p>

        <h2>From Goals to Designs</h2>
        <p>Defining concrete goals for the project and getting the team aligned on the goals was a significant milestone for this project. After the goals were defined, I had a little over a week's time to deliver designs for the MVP version. I took the time-constrained situation as a challenge and dove right into the execution phase. I had a lot of fun during this phase since I work well with short timelines, and I was quite motivated after the research phase to create something meaningful. Apart from the constrained timeline, here were some other challenges for this project:</p>

        <h2>Understand current experiences – both physical and digital</h2>
        <p>I started off by deeply understanding the current Wish Local interface as well as the physical experience holistically. Doing this activity gave two positive results:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
          <li>The journey map I created for the lifecycle of an item helped the PM think about the Wish Local journey in new and holistic ways. She used this diagram to onboard new PMs to her team</li>
          <li>It helped us identify an opportunity to make the Information Architecture of the app better, thus laying a solid foundation to add new inventory management features</li>

        <p>Keeping the Job stories in front of me at all times, I began the quite fun process of ideation. Key design consideration was that we had to design an organizational structure in the app that works for ALL stores because:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
          <li>Not all stores had the same needs</li>
          <li>Some were smaller stores with a limited amount of space, some were bigger and could afford a more organized structure</li>
          <li>Thus, how stores organized items in their location differed, and they wanted that particular organization in the app</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Early thinking around the layout</h2>
        <p>One of the key challenges for the project was the lack of competitors to draw inspiration from. I did some analogous comparative analysis and considered two ideas.</p> 
        <p>The first was to have a dashboard showing all item bundles. Clicking on a bundle on the dashboard would reveal items within it. This was similar to Smart Recruiters's (a recruiting software) dashboard. However, the downside was that this layout would cost an interaction to view any item since items would be "hidden" one level deep.</p>
        <p>The second was to show all items upfront with an option to sort/search similar to an Orders page on Amazon. The biggest advantage of this layout was that the actual orders were always visible and not hidden one level deep.</p>
        <p>I sketched out a few layout options and decided to go with the Amazon orders like layout because of its lesser interaction cost.</p>

        <p>This was the 20% of the design that took the longest to get "right". As highlighted in the Project Journey Mapping, since I had just over a week to create the design before dev handoff, I handed off a design that I wasn't quite happy with.</p>
        <p>However, this stayed in my mind so I kept iterating in a separate Figma page. I also set up a meeting called "Design experiments" with my PM and UX Writer to get their thoughts on the different iterations I was creating. I did make it clear, however, that the designs won't change in the MASTER page in Figma (that developers were referencing) unless there is buy-in from all stakeholders.</p>
        <p>So, how did I manage to get this 20% design right, and into the dev pipeline? After handing off this project, my next project was to add 2 new item activities + action types. Since this project was touching the Activity section, I eventually was able to create a design for this 20% section that I was personally satisfied with.</p>
        <p>Now the hard part was to get this into the dev pipeline. I set up a meeting with the PM + Writer, and pitched two versions for my current project – one was using the handed-off design, and another was using the new design.</p>
        <p>Seeing both designs side by side, the benefits of the new design were quite visible, and the PM got onboard with the new version. My only constraint was that I had to stick with the design system components to ease development effort.</p>
        <p>We set up a meeting with the developers elaborating on the ROI of the new design and got these new 20% designs in the dev pipeline.</p>

        <h2>A big update to Wish Local</h2>
        <p>These new inventory management tools were launched for all Wish Local stores (60k+) on November 1st, 2021, and are making their lives easier. We are closely monitoring our customer support channels to see how these tools are helping stores, as well as making note of the number of store complaints around managing inventory to measure success.</p>
        <p>This was a significant update to Wish Local. According to my Product Manager, this was the biggest Wish Local project she had worked on since she joined (~2 years).</p>
        <p>The outcome of this project was better than our expectations. The operations team mentioned that these features would be a boon for stores. Thus, we decided to do heavy feature marketing for this project – we sent an email mentioning a big upcoming update to Wish Local before the feature was launched, and are posting about the different features on our social media channels.</p>
